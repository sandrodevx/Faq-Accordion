## Features
- **Interactive FAQ Section**: Click on a question to reveal the answer.
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for expanding and collapsing answers.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **No JavaScript**: Built purely with HTML and CSS.

## How It Works
- Each FAQ item consists of a hidden checkbox, a label (the question), and a div (the answer).
- When the checkbox is checked, the adjacent sibling selector (`+`) in CSS is used to reveal the answer.
- The `max-height` property and CSS transitions are used to create smooth animations.
